## leaflet-challenge

### Description:
The USGS is responsible for providing scientific data about natural hazards, the health of our ecosystems and environment; and the impacts of climate and land-use change. Their scientists develop new methods and tools to supply timely, relevant, and useful information about the Earth and its processes. 

The USGS is interested in building a new set of tools that will allow them visualize their earthquake data. They collect a massive amount of data from all over the world each day, but they lack a meaningful way of displaying it. Their hope is that being able to visualize their data will allow them to better educate the public and other government organizations (and hopefully secure more funding..) on issues facing our planet.

### Visualizing the Earthquake Dataset:
The leaflet-challenge exploresthe earthquake data for the last 7 days.  Map marker size indicates magnitude of the earthquakes, while the colors represent the depth.  The higher the magnitude, the larger the circles.  The greater the depth, the darker the color.  Below is a screenshot of the map created using leaflet.
